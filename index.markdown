I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Aberdeen (Scotland, UK) specialising in all things front end. I build websites for a living and have worked in the creative industry for over 10 years.

I started my career building native and cross-platform mobile apps before transitioning over to Website Development. I spend most of my time these days building fully customised CMS's, online stores (e-commerce), landing pages as well as some other cool stuff.

Currently working alongside the amazingly talented team at <a href="https://fortytwo.studio">FortyTwo Studio</a>. When I'm not working I listen to music (Like A LOT). Check out my weekly updated <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ross_182/playlist/5kNNTTP9FJ9de376BOnkr5?si=5Oco2FYnQVOi_Oi09liCMg">Spotify Playlist</a> of stuff I'm listening to.
