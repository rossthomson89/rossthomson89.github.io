Well if you're reading this article, you already know this has been launched huh? It's been a project years in the making and took several tries and re-starts before I finally took a step back and I settled on one main criteria - cost. 

My portfolio site originally started out as a Craft CMS build and was hosted on a linux server but I never really got round to finishing it... Therefore, I was spending cash on a few services and licenses I was never actually using - which does seem daft in retrospect. I started again, but this time I was doing it on the cheap.

A portfolio website needs to showcase a number of different things, but there's also some things this site didn't need to be: 
* **It doesn't need to be fancy** - showcase my work/experience/portfolio. Keep it simple
* **It doesn't need to be super dynamic** - how often will the site update anyway? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* **It shouldn't be expensive** - no point in paying for services I don't need

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a solution I'd recommend to most of my clients (or anyone who isn't a developer for that matter) but I run this site for around $35(¬£27) per year. That's only ¬£2.25 a month! Which is sure within most people's budget? This cost however is purely down to the yearly cost for my domain (rossthomson.dev). There's no hosting fees. No license fees. It's all open source, and it's all free. The site is also incredibly secure because a static website has no database to manipulate. Here's the stack used: 

* **Hosting:** <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">Github Pages</a>
* **Repository:** <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
* **Blog/CMS Functionality:** <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="blank">Jekyll</a> (static site generator)
* **Form Functionality:** <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="blank">Formspree</a>
* **Font:** <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="blank">Google Fonts</a> (Open Sans)
* **Programming/Design:** By yours truly

I'll put together a multi-part tutorial on how I implemented this site in the near future for any aspiring web developers who want a flat file site on the cheap - so watch this space.
